# Overview

In this tutorial, we will take a look on how to secure an API gateway.

This tutorial is based on the code we implemented in [Getting Started with Docker tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker/). If you didn't complete the tutorial, we highly encourage you to do so.

# Prerequisites

- JDK 8
- Docker (not required, you can use Stack distribution as well)
- [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)

To keep things simple, we'll start from the code already implemented in the tutorial mentioned before, which is available [here](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-example-project/tree/master/distribution/getting-started).

Let's quickly recap on the things we'll reuse here.

We've already implemented the `HelloWorldHandlerFactory` which simply prints the configured message to the HTTP response. All the details are available [here](/tutorials/getting-started-with-knotx-stack/2_0/) in section _API implementation: creating new Handler_.

In this tutorial we'll make sure that this handler is accessible only for authenticated users.

# Basic Auth

[Basic auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) is the most basic way of authenticating your requests. It's a simple username/password credential driven security.

## Configure basic auth in OpenAPI

As always, we'll use the [Design First approach](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/design-first-or-code-first-api-development/), therefore we'll modify our [Open API 3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) configuration file.

> You might have already noticed how we use _swagger.io_ and _OpenAPI_ references alternately, depending on what we find more readable for the situation. It's good to understand the difference between them:
>
> *_OpenAPI_* is the specification and *_Swagger_* is a set of tools for implementing the specification.
>
> For more information see [this article](https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/).

Let's add a new endpoint in the `paths:` section and a new `securityScheme`  in the [`components`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/components/) section:

`knotx/conf/openapi.yaml`
```yaml
paths:
  /api/secure/basic: // endpoint with basic authentication
    get:
      operationId: hello-world-operation-basic
      security:
        - helloBasicAuth: [] // here we specify which security scheme we'll be using (see below)
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Hello World API protected with Basic Auth
        '401':
          description: Anauthorized access
```

Notice different responses defined for the secured endpoint. For more info on different responses see [this tutorial](/tutorials/openapi-and-swagger-ui/2_0/).

Now let's create security scheme definitions. We'll place it in a separate place in the same file as above in [`components`](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#componentsObject) section. For now we'll have only one [`securityScheme`](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#securitySchemeObject) called `helloBasicAuth`:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    helloBasicAuth: // our custom security scheme ...
      type: http  // ... with a http type ...
      scheme: basic   // ... with a Basic Auth scheme
```

For more information on `basic` scheme see [this documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/).

Now we'll take care of handling our operations and security schemas. Let's modify `knotx/conf/routes/operations.conf`:

```hocon
routingOperations = ${routingOperations} [
  {
    operationId = hello-world-operation-basic
    handlers = [
      {
        name = hellohandler
        config = {
          message = "Hello World From Knot.x with Basic Auth!"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

As we can see, we reuse our `hellohandler` implemented in `HelloWorldHandlerFactory`, but with different message.

Now let's add security handlers (in the same file):

```hocon
securityHandlers = [
  {
    schema = helloBasicAuth
    factory = helloBasicAuthFactory
    config = {
      properties_path = "classpath:basicauth/users.properties"
    }
  }
]
```

We provided an array of [`securityHandlers`](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http#routing-security). It's a collection of objects which map `schema` with `factory` that must implement [`AuthHandlerFactory`](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/tree/master/api#creating-auth-handler) interface. We can also pass some config here (more on that later).

It is worth noting that operations are not aware of any security they will be behind of.

## Authentication Handler implementation

For the purpose of this tutorial let's add a new module to our project. Let's name it `security-module` and give it the following structure.:


```
modules
└─ security-module
    ├── build.gradle.kts                                                    // gradle build script
    └── src
        └── main
            ├── java/io/knotx/examples/security/auth
            │     └── BasicAuthHandlerFactory.java                          // the handler factory
            └── resources
                  ├── basicauth
                  │   └── users.properties                                  // our config file
                  └── META-INF/services
                      └── io.knotx.server.api.security.AuthHandlerFactory   // META-INF file used by Knot.x to find the handler
```

The `modules/security-module/build.gradle.kts` takes care of any dependencies we'll need in this tutorial:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    "io.knotx:knotx".let { v ->
        implementation(platform("$v-dependencies:${project.property("knotx.version")}"))
        implementation("$v-fragments-handler-api:${project.property("knotx.version")}")
    }
    "io.vertx:vertx".let { v ->
        implementation("$v-core")
        implementation("$v-rx-java2")
        implementation("$v-health-check")
        implementation("$v-auth-shiro")
    }
    "org.apache".let { v ->
        compile("$v.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5.3")
        compile("$v.commons:commons-lang3:3.9")
    }
}
```

Let's not forget to add the module to the main `settings.gradle.kts`!

```kotlin
include("security-module")
// ...
project(":security-module").projectDir = file("modules/security-module")
```

Now let's focus on the `resources` directory.

Let's get back to the `securityHandlers` we defined before. The configuration we pass to `helloBasicAuthFactory` is a path to user/roles configuration file.

In this example we'll be using Vert.x's implementation of [Apache Shiro Auth](https://shiro.apache.org/index.html) for handling users, their credentials and privileges. Therefore, the configuration must be in a format described [here](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-auth-shiro/java/#_the_shiro_properties_auth_provider).

As mentioned before, we'll create the file in module's `resources/basicauth` folder and name it `users.properties`.

Let's create a sample user `john` with a super secure password. He'll have an `administrator` role which has all the permissions (`*`):

`users.properties`
```
user.john = s3cr3t,administrator
role.administrator=*
```

Now let's take care of the actual authentication handler factory implementation:

`BasicAuthHandlerFactory.java`
```java
package io.knotx.examples.security.auth;

import io.knotx.server.api.security.AuthHandlerFactory;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.ext.auth.shiro.ShiroAuthOptions;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.auth.shiro.ShiroAuth;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.handler.AuthHandler;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.handler.BasicAuthHandler;

public class BasicAuthHandlerFactory implements AuthHandlerFactory {

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "helloBasicAuthFactory";
  }

  @Override
  public AuthHandler create(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    final ShiroAuth shiroAuth = ShiroAuth.create(vertx, new ShiroAuthOptions().setConfig(config));
    return BasicAuthHandler.create(shiroAuth);
  }
}
```

It's as simple as creating a [`BasicAuthHandler`](https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/ext/web/handler/BasicAuthHandler.html) that will use [`ShiroAuth`](https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/ext/auth/shiro/ShiroAuth.html) instance created with our config.

Let's not forget to register our factory for [Java ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html):

`io.knotx.server.api.security.AuthHandlerFactory`
```
io.knotx.examples.security.auth.BasicAuthHandlerFactory
```

## Build & Run

In this tutorial we'll be using the Docker distribution, but it will work with Stack distribution as well. Please refer to [this tutorial](http://knotx.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-knotx-stack/2_0/) on how to work with the Stack distribution.

First, let's rename the Docker image we're about to create:

`gradle.properties`
```
// ...
docker.image.name=knotx-example/secure-api-gateway
// ...
```

Now let's build the image:

```
$ gradlew clean build-docker
```

and run it:

```
$ docker run -p8092:8092 knotx-example/secure-api-gateway
```

After a while the Docker container should be up and running.

Let's try accessing our endpoint:

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/api/secure/basic
Unauthorized
```

As expected - we were not authorized to access this endpoint.

Let's try again with a valid `Authorization` header. The header should be a Base64-encoded string of pair of `username:password` prepended with `Basic` keyword,  as described [here](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/system-administration/basic-auth#basic-authentication-format):

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/api/secure/basic -H 'Authorization: Basic am9objpzM2NyM3Q='
{"message":"Hello World From Knot.x with Basic Auth!"}
```

## Functional tests

It's always a good practice to test our code. Let's implement some tests that will automatically do the same things we did manually above.

The tests we're about to write will be functional tests, that will be executed on a real, running Docker image, just after the `healthcheck` (described in [this tutorial](http://knotx.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker/2_0/)) executes successfully.

Let's add a new file: `functional/src/test/java/com/project/test/functional/BasicAuthITCase.java`

```java
class BasicAuthITCase {

  @Test
  @DisplayName("GIVEN no authorization WHEN call basicAuth API EXPECT Unauthorized")
  void givenNoAuthorizationWhenCallBasicAuthApiExpectUnauthorized() {
    given()
        .port(8092)
      .when()
        .get("/api/secure/basic")
      .then()
        .assertThat()
        .statusCode(401);
  }

  @Test
  @DisplayName("GIVEN authorization WHEN call basicAuth API EXPECT Ok")
  void givenAuthorizationWhenCallBasicAuthApiExpectOk() {
    given()
        .port(8092)
        .header("Authorization", "Basic am9objpzM2NyM3Q=")
      .when()
        .get("/api/secure/basic")
      .then()
        .assertThat()
        .statusCode(200);
  }
}
```

We've created two simple tests using [REST-assured](http://rest-assured.io/). They do the same actions we did above:

- call secured endpoint without authorization and expect `401 - Unauthorized` response
- call the same endpoint with authorization and expect `200 - OK` response

If you try rebuilding the project now (remember to stop any running containers before that) you'll notice that those test will be invoked. Now we're confident that if our future changes will somehow disable or modify our `/api/secure/basic` logic, we'll know at build time!

# Summary

In this tutorial we have successfully secured our API Gateway with the most basic authentication method.

Using Basic Auth we can set up credential-based security in no time! The beauty of this is that the business logic is not aware of the security layer standing right in front of it.
