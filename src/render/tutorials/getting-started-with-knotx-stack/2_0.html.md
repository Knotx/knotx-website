## Overview

In this tutorial, we will set up a simple project based on the [Knot.x Starter Kit](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit) template.

We will implement a custom handler that will print a "Hello world from Knot.x!" message.

### Prerequisites
- JDK 8
- Linux or OSX bash console (for Windows users we recommend using e.g. Ubuntu with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10))

### What you’re going to learn:

- How to use the [Design First approach](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/design-first-or-code-first-api-development/) to design the API's contract first before writing any code configuring [Open API specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) entries
- How to implement a custom business logic, the Knot.x [Handler](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http#knotx-http-server), and apply it to configured API

Download the [Latest Knot.x Starter Kit release](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit/releases) and unzip it. 

Please note that the support for ZIP distribution was added [here](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit/pull/17). If your version does not contain those changes you can easily apply them with upgrade notes.

Project has the following structure:
```
├── docker
|   ├── Dockerfile                // Docker file with image definition. It will be not used in this tutorial.
├── functional                    // Keep here your functional tests. Example implementation included
├── gradle                        // Gradle wrapper and common gradle scripts
├── knotx/conf                    // Knotx configuration which will be copied to distribution ZIP
├── modules                       // Sub-modules of your project
│   ├── ...                       // example modules implementation
```

## Configure API: specify path and method

When it comes to API development, two approaches are available: The “Design First” and the “Code First”. You can read more details [here](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/design-first-or-code-first-api-development/) to understand the differences between them. Knot.x uses the Design First approach focusing on developer experience and API design quality. It uses the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) to configure HTTP request routing.

The `knotx/conf/openapi.yaml` file contains project-specific API definitions using the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) syntax.

We can see three distinguishable parts of this file:

 1.  Information about the project, which is quite self-explanatory:
 
      ```yaml
      ...
      
      openapi: "3.0.0"
      info:
        version: 1.0.0
        title: Knot.x Starter Kit
        description: Knotx Starter Kit
        contact: 
          name: "Knot.x Community"
          url: "https://knotx.io/community/"
        
      ...
      ```      
 2.  Server configuration that defines how the server behaves:
 
      ```yaml
      ...
      
      servers:
        - url: https://{domain}:{port}
          description: The local API server
          variables:
            domain:
              default: localhost
              description: api domain
            port:
              enum:
                - '8092'
              default: '8092'
      
      ...
      ```
      Here we can see, for example, that the server will be registered on port `8092`. Notice variable substitution indicated by `{`brackets`}`. For more information on what can be configured here, see [this documentation](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#serverObject). 
 3.  Paths configuration that explicitly specifies the endpoints, their paths, methods, responses and much more in a clear, easily readable and declarative way:
 
      ```yaml
      ...
      
      paths: 
      
        ...   
             
        /healthcheck:
          get:
            operationId: healthcheck-operation
            # https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-health-check/java/
            responses:
              '200':
                description: Everything is fine
              '204':
                description: No procedure are registered.
              '501':
                description: At least one procedure has reported a non-healthy status
              '500':
                description: One procedure has thrown an error or has not reported a status in time
      ...
      ```
      
> In OpenAPI terms, paths are endpoints (resources), such as `/users` or `/reports/summary/`, that your API exposes, and operations are the HTTP methods used to manipulate these paths, such as GET, POST or DELETE. (read more [here](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/))

The Starter Kit template comes with example paths and methods defined. Let's see the `/healthcheck` API. It is used to express the current state of the application in very simple terms: UP or DOWN (more on that [in the second tutorial](https://knotx.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker/2_0/)).
      
We can see that it is registered under `/healthcheck` path, it's method is a `GET` and it can have various responses depending on the state of the instance.
      
A configured path and method section declares a unique operation that is used to process matching requests. In the example above, it is `healthcheck-operation`. Details how to link configured operation with the business logic implementation will be covered later.
      
Now, it is time to define a custom endpoint `/api/hello` and operation `hello-world-operation`.

Simply add new routing configuration under `paths`:
```yaml
paths:
  /api/hello:
    get:
      operationId: hello-world-operation
      responses:
        default:
          description: Example API implemented in this tutorial
```

## Configure API: define a new operation

As previously mentioned, a configured path and method indicates [operation](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#operationObject) to perform. Every operation is configured as a [Routing Operation](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/tree/master#routing-operations) entry that specifies Handlers with business logic to execute and failure Handlers when processing fails. 


All routing operation entries are configured in the `knotx/conf/routes/operations.conf` file. It is the first time the Knot.x configuration appears. It uses the HOCON (*Human-Optimized Config Object Notation*) syntax. More on HOCON  can be found in [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md).

Let's take a look at this file:

```hocon
routingOperations = ${routingOperations} [
  
  // routing operations for this project
  
]
```

`routingOperations` is an array of `routingOperation` objects. 

`${routingOperations}` takes care of merging any [previously defined](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-stack/blob/master/src/main/packaging/conf/server.conf) routing operations with the ones you define here. More about HOCON concatenation possibilities can be found [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#array-and-object-concatenation).

Let's take a look at an example routing operation entry we get from Starter Kit:
```hocon
  {
    operationId = healthcheck-operation
    handlers = [
      {
        name = healthcheck
      }
    ]
  }
```

The `healthcheck-operation` operation defines the array of [Handlers](https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Handler.html) with a single Handler, named `healthcheck`. Please note that Handlers can be easily reused so `healthcheck` is a Handler's factory unique name.

Let's take a look at a more complicated one:
```hocon
{
    operationId = example-api-with-fragments-operation
    handlers = ${config.server.handlers.common.request} [
      {
        name = singleFragmentSupplier
        config = {
          type = json
          configuration {
            data-knotx-task = api-task
          }
        }
      },
      {
        name = fragmentsHandler
        config = { include required(classpath("routes/handlers/api-with-fragments.conf")) }
      },
      {
        name = fragmentsAssembler
      }
    ] ${config.server.handlers.common.response}
  }
```

Here we provide not one, but three different handlers. By defining them in an array, they will be called in order they're defined. Some of them even have some additional configurations defined explicitly or in another file. They will be passed as `JsonObject`s to the handler implementation.

Notice two additional imports: `${config.server.handlers.common.request}` and `${config.server.handlers.common.response}`. Here we use the handlers defined in [Knot.x source code](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/blob/master/conf/server.conf), which simplifies handling of basic requests without repeating the configuration for similar operations.

Now, let's connect `hello-world-operation` with a handler. The name of the handler factory will be `hellohandler` (reminder: names must be unique!). We'll also make the message configurable.

Simply add new routing operation to the array:

```hocon
  {
    operationId = hello-world-operation
    handlers = [
      {
        name = hellohandler
        config = {
          message = "Hello World From Knot.x!"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

## API implementation: creating new Handler

Now it is time to code some custom logic printing *"Hello World from Knot.x!"*. We will implement the [RoutingHandlerFactory](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/blob/master/api/src/main/java/io/knotx/server/api/handler/RoutingHandlerFactory.java) interface. We use Java but you can use any JVM-based language, such as [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). Let's put it in a separate module.


Create a new module under the `modules` folder. The structure should look like this:

```
modules
└─ hellomodule
    ├── build.gradle.kts                                                        // gradle build script
    └── src 
        └── main                   
            ├── java/com/project/example/hellohandler
            │     └── HelloWorldHandlerFactory.java                             // the handler factory  
            └── resources
                  └── META-INF/services
                        └── io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory   // META-INF file used by Knot.x to find the handler   
```

Let's take a look at the three files required for the module to work.

`build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
plugins {
    `java-library`
}

dependencies {

    "io.knotx:knotx".let { v ->
        implementation(platform("$v-dependencies:${project.property("knotx.version")}"))
        api("$v-fragments-api:${project.property("knotx.version")}")
        api("$v-fragments-handler-api:${project.property("knotx.version")}")
    }
    "io.vertx:vertx".let { v ->
        implementation("$v-web")
        implementation("$v-web-client")
        implementation("$v-rx-java2")
    }
}
```

`io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory`
```
io.knotx.example.hellohandler.HelloWorldHandlerFactory
```

In this file we list, line by line, all the [RoutingHandlerFactory](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/blob/master/api/src/main/java/io/knotx/server/api/handler/RoutingHandlerFactory.java) implementations we want Knot.x to see. It has to be a canonical class name. It uses [Java ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html).

`HelloWorldHandlerFactory.java`
```
package io.knotx.example.hellohandler;

import io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory;
import io.vertx.core.Handler;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.RoutingContext;

public class HelloWorldHandlerFactory implements RoutingHandlerFactory {

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "hellohandler";    // this has to be exactly the same unique string as in operations.conf file                                                 
  }

  @Override
  public Handler<RoutingContext> create(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    String message = config.getString("message", "Some default message");
    JsonObject jsonObject = new JsonObject()
        .put("message", message);
    return event -> event.response().end(jsonObject.toString());
  }
}
```

The most important thing is to register it by its name. In this case, it was `"hellohandler"`. 

The handling it performs is simply ending the response with previously configured *"Hello World from Knot.x!"* JSON.

Finally, let's update the main project's `settings.gradle.kts` file, so that it will recognize the new module. 

Simply add those two lines:
```kotlin
include("hello-module")
```
and
```kotlin
project(":hello-module").projectDir = file("modules/hello-module")
```

## Build & Run

The process of distributing Knot.x via stack is the following:

```
$ ./gradlew build
```

This command is building the distributable zip archive. It can be found under `build/distributions` directory.

This archive is fully functional Knot.x distribution and can be deployed on any Unix-based machine.

In order to run it, first we need to unzip it.

```
$ cd build/distributions
$ unzip knotx-stack-<version of your project>.zip
```

Now let's navigate to unzipped `knotx` folder and make `knotx/bin/knotx` file executable.

```
$ cd knotx
$ chmod +x bin/knotx
```

The final step is executing the starting script:

```
$ bin/knotx run-knotx
```

The application should start.

After a while it should be up and running and the endpoint can be accessed. Let's execute the command:

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/api/hello
{"message":"Hello World From Knot.x!"}
```

### Debugging

For manual on how to debug the application see [this documentation](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit#docker-debugging).
