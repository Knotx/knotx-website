# Overview

In this tutorial, we will take a look on how to secure an API gateway.

This tutorial is based on the code we implemented in [Getting Started with Docker tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker/). If you didn't complete the tutorial, we highly encourage you to do so.

# Table of contents

1. Implementing Basic Auth security - a basic username/password credential driven security.
2. Implementing JWT security - a very common approach based on tokens.
3. Implementing OAuth2 security with Google - authentication using external provider.

Each part ends with an independent, working example. It's not required to go through each of them continuously, but the first one contains the instruction on how to add a new module and include it to the build.

# Prerequisites

- JDK 8
- Docker (not required, you can use Stack distribution as well)
- [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
- Google account (for the OAuth2 / OpenID Connect implementation)

To keep things simple, we'll start from the code already implemented in the tutorial mentioned before, which is available [here](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-example-project/tree/master/distribution/getting-started).

Let's quickly recap on the things we'll reuse here.

We've already implemented the `HelloWorldHandlerFactory` which simply prints the configured message to the HTTP response. All the details are available [here](/tutorials/getting-started-with-knotx-stack/2_0/) in section _API implementation: creating new Handler_.

In this tutorial we'll make sure that this handler is accessible only for authenticated users.

# Basic Auth

Let's start with the most basic way of authenticating our requests - [Basic auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

## Configure basic auth in OpenAPI

As always, we'll use the [Design First approach](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/design-first-or-code-first-api-development/), therefore we'll modify our [Open API 3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) configuration file.

> You might have already noticed how we use _swagger.io_ and _OpenAPI_ references alternately, depending on what we find more readable for the situation. It's good to understand the difference between them:
>
> *_OpenAPI_* is the specification and *_Swagger_* is a set of tools for implementing the specification.
>
> For more information see [this article](https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/).

Let's add two new endpoints in the `paths:` section and a new `securityScheme`  in the [`components`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/components/) section:

`knotx/conf/openapi.yaml`
```yaml
paths:
  /api/secure/basic: // endpoint with basic authentication
    get:
      operationId: hello-world-operation-basic
      security:
        - helloBasicAuth: [] // here we specify which security scheme we'll be using (see below)
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Hello World API protected with Basic Auth
        '401':
          description: Anauthorized access
```

Notice different responses defined for the secured endpoint. For more info on different responses see [this tutorial](/tutorials/openapi-and-swagger-ui/2_0/).

Now let's create security scheme definitions. We'll place it in a separate place in the same file as above in [`components`](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#componentsObject) section. For now we'll have only one [`securityScheme`](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#securitySchemeObject) called `helloBasicAuth`:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    helloBasicAuth: // our custom security scheme ...
      type: http  // ... with a http type ...
      scheme: basic   // ... with a Basic Auth scheme
```

For more information on `basic` scheme see [this documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/).

Now we'll take care of handling our operations and security schemas. Let's modify `knotx/conf/routes/operations.conf`:

```hocon
routingOperations = ${routingOperations} [
  {
    operationId = hello-world-operation-basic
    handlers = [
      {
        name = hellohandler
        config = {
          message = "Hello World From Knot.x with Basic Auth!"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

As we can see, we reuse our `hellohandler` implemented in `HelloWorldHandlerFactory`, but with different messages each time.

Now let's add security handlers (in the same file):

```hocon
securityHandlers = [
  {
    schema = helloBasicAuth
    factory = helloBasicAuthFactory
    config = {
      properties_path = "classpath:basicauth/users.properties"
    }
  }
]
```

We provided an array of [`securityHandlers`](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http#routing-security). It's a collection of objects which map `schema` with `factory` that must implement [`AuthHandlerFactory`](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/tree/master/api#creating-auth-handler) interface. We can also pass some config here (more on that later).

It is worth noting that operations are not aware of any security they will be behind of.

## Authentication Handler implementation

For the purpose of this tutorial let's add a new module to our project. Let's name it `security-module` and give it the following structure.:


```
modules
└─ security-module
    ├── build.gradle.kts                                                    // gradle build script
    └── src
        └── main
            ├── java/io/knotx/examples/security/auth
            │     └── BasicAuthHandlerFactory.java                          // the handler factory
            └── resources
                  ├── basicauth
                  │   └── users.properties                                  // our config file
                  └── META-INF/services
                      └── io.knotx.server.api.security.AuthHandlerFactory   // META-INF file used by Knot.x to find the handler
```

The `modules/security-module/build.gradle.kts` takes care of any dependencies we'll need in this tutorial:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    "io.knotx:knotx".let { v ->
        implementation(platform("$v-dependencies:${project.property("knotx.version")}"))
        implementation("$v-fragments-handler-api:${project.property("knotx.version")}")
    }
    "io.vertx:vertx".let { v ->
        implementation("$v-core")
        implementation("$v-rx-java2")
        implementation("$v-health-check")
        implementation("$v-auth-shiro")
    }
    "org.apache".let { v ->
        compile("$v.httpcomponents:httpclient:4.5.3")
        compile("$v.commons:commons-lang3:3.9")
    }
}
```

Let's not forget to add the module to the main `settings.gradle.kts`!

```kotlin
include("security-module")
// ...
project(":security-module").projectDir = file("modules/security-module")
```

Now let's focus on the `resources` directory.

Let's get back to the `securityHandlers` we defined before. The configuration we pass to `helloBasicAuthFactory` is a path to user/roles configuration file.

In this example we'll be using Vert.x's implementation of [Apache Shiro Auth](https://shiro.apache.org/index.html) for handling users, their credentials and privileges. Therefore, the configuration must be in a format described [here](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-auth-shiro/java/#_the_shiro_properties_auth_provider).

As mentioned before, we'll create the file in module's `resources/basicauth` folder and name it `users.properties`.

Let's create a sample user `john` with a super secure password. He'll have an `administrator` role which has all the permissions (`*`):

`users.properties`
```
user.john = s3cr3t,administrator
role.administrator=*
```

Now let's take care of the actual authentication handler factory implementation:

`BasicAuthHandlerFactory.java`
```java
package io.knotx.examples.security.auth;

import io.knotx.server.api.security.AuthHandlerFactory;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.ext.auth.shiro.ShiroAuthOptions;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.auth.shiro.ShiroAuth;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.handler.AuthHandler;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.handler.BasicAuthHandler;

public class BasicAuthHandlerFactory implements AuthHandlerFactory {

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "helloBasicAuthFactory";
  }

  @Override
  public AuthHandler create(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    final ShiroAuth shiroAuth = ShiroAuth.create(vertx, new ShiroAuthOptions().setConfig(config));
    return BasicAuthHandler.create(shiroAuth);
  }
}
```

It's as simple as creating a [`BasicAuthHandler`](https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/ext/web/handler/BasicAuthHandler.html) that will use [`ShiroAuth`](https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/ext/auth/shiro/ShiroAuth.html) instance created with our config.

Let's not forget to register our factory for [Java ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html):

`io.knotx.server.api.security.AuthHandlerFactory`
```
io.knotx.examples.security.auth.BasicAuthHandlerFactory
```

## Build & Run

In this tutorial we'll be using the Docker distribution, but it will work with Stack distribution as well. Please refer to [this tutorial](http://knotx.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-knotx-stack/2_0/) on how to work with the Stack distribution.

First, let's rename the Docker image we're about to create:

`gradle.properties`
```
// ...
docker.image.name=knotx-example/secure-api-gateway
// ...
```

Now let's build the image:

```
$ gradlew clean build-docker
```

and run it:

```
$ docker run -p8092:8092 knotx-example/secure-api-gateway
```

After a while the Docker container should be up and running.

Let's try accessing our endpoints:

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/api/secure/basic
Unauthorized
```

As expected - we were not authorized to access this endpoint.

Let's try again with a valid `Authorization` header. The header should be a Base64-encoded string of pair of `username:password` prepended with `Basic` keyword,  as described [here](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/system-administration/basic-auth#basic-authentication-format):

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/api/secure/basic -H 'Authorization: Basic am9objpzM2NyM3Q='
{"message":"Hello World From Knot.x with Basic Auth!"}
```

## Functional tests

It's always a good practice to test our code. Let's implement some tests that will automatically do the same things we did manually above.

The tests we're about to write will be functional tests, that will be executed on a real, running Docker image, just after the `healthcheck` (described in [this tutorial](http://knotx.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-docker/2_0/)) executes successfully.

Let's add a new file: `functional/src/test/java/com/project/test/functional/BasicAuthITCase.java`

```java
class BasicAuthITCase {

  @Test
  @DisplayName("GIVEN no authorization WHEN call basicAuth API EXPECT Unauthorized")
  void givenNoAuthorizationWhenCallBasicAuthApiExpectUnauthorized() {
    given()
        .port(8092)
      .when()
        .get("/api/secure/basic")
      .then()
        .assertThat()
        .statusCode(401);
  }

  @Test
  @DisplayName("GIVEN authorization WHEN call basicAuth API EXPECT Ok")
  void givenAuthorizationWhenCallBasicAuthApiExpectOk() {
    given()
        .port(8092)
        .header("Authorization", "Basic am9objpzM2NyM3Q=")
      .when()
        .get("/api/secure/basic")
      .then()
        .assertThat()
        .statusCode(200);
  }
}
```

We've created two simple tests using [REST-assured](http://rest-assured.io/). They do the same actions we did above:

- call secured endpoint without authorization and expect `401 - Unauthorized` response
- call the same endpoint with authorization and expect `200 - OK` response

If you try rebuilding the project now (remember to stop any running containers before that) you'll notice that those test will be invoked. Now we're confident that if our future changes will somehow disable or modify our `/api/secure/basic` logic, we'll know at build time!

# JWT

Now let's do something fancier than just passing the credentials. We'll use [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/).

A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a well-known solution for API authorization.
The JWT allows verifying the owner of some JSON data. The JSON data stored in a JWT is serialized, not encrypted. So it can be seen by anyone (remember to always use HTTPS).

However, it is cryptographically signed by the authentication provider. So no one can modify it, it guarantees that can be trusted.

The JWT Authentication flow looks like this:

![JWT flow](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-jwt-flow.png)

1. A user logs in with his/her credentials.
2. The user receives an encrypted JWT in a cookie tagged with the HttpOnly flag (it tells that only the server can access this particular cookie).
3. From now, all requests within the same domain contain JWT token and secured API can verify them (those endpoints share the same signing key).

> Please note that, for simplicity, we specify JWT in HTTP headers. Usually, there is some Apache front server that rewrites an authentication cookie to HTTP headers.

Since we'll be focusing only on step 3, we'll mimic the result of the other two by generating the token ourselves.

## Configure JWT auth in OpenAPI

Let's start with setting up our secured API.

We'll need a new endpoint and a new security schema:

`knotx/conf/openapi.yaml`
```yaml
// ...

paths:
  // ...
  /api/secure/jwt:
    get:
      operationId: hello-world-operation-jwt
      security:
          - helloJwtAuth: []
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Hello World API protected with JWT
        '401':
          description: Anauthorized access

components:
  securitySchemes:
    // ...
    helloJwtAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
```

Again, we defined a new endpoint and attached security schema with JWT bearer auth.

Now, let's take care of our new operation `hello-world-operation-jwt` and security scheme `helloJwtAuth`:

`knotx/conf/routing/operations.conf`
```hocon
routingOperations = ${routingOperations} [
  // ...
  {
    operationId = hello-world-operation-jwt
    handlers = [
      {
        name = hellohandler
        config = {
          message = "Hello World From Knot.x with JWT!"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]

securityHandlers = [
  // ...
  {
    schema = helloJwtAuth
    factory = helloJwtAuthFactory
    config = {
      algorithm = "HS256"
      publicKey = "M0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6"
      symmetric = true
    }
  }
]
```

Again, we're reusing `hellohandler` with some different message without any changes in the code. Authentication / authorization logic is not a part of the routing handler implementation.

As for security handlers, we'll be using a new factory with a configuration as above: `HS256` mentioned above with a `symmetric` key. A signature is generated by calculating a digest using the HMAC-SHA256 hashing algorithm. The key used in HMAC is, by definition, symmetric. A symmetric key is used for both to encrypt and decrypt JWT. So we need to configure two properties: `symmetric` and `publicKey`. More info available [here](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-auth-jwt/java/#_loading_keys).

> Be careful not to disclose your private keys anywhere publicly!

## Implementation

First, we have to add dependency to Vert.x's JWT implementation:

> In case you didn't complete the _Basic Auth_ part of this tutorial, you might want to scroll up a bit to the _Authentication Handler implementation_ part and see the `security-module` structure we defined there. Don't forget to add the module in `settings.gradle.kts` as well!

`modules/security-module/build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...
    "io.vertx:vertx".let { v ->
        // ...
        implementation("$v-auth-jwt")
    }
    // ...
}
```

Now let's implement our handler factory. Create a class in the `security-module` we created earlier, right next to `BasicAuthHandlerFactory.java` (in case you didn't complete the _Basic Auth_ part of this tutorial, just scroll up to the project structure mentioned before and place this class where it would be normally):

`JwtAuthHandlerFactory.java`
```java
package io.knotx.examples.security.auth;

import io.knotx.server.api.security.AuthHandlerFactory;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.ext.auth.PubSecKeyOptions;
import io.vertx.ext.auth.jwt.JWTAuthOptions;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.auth.jwt.JWTAuth;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.handler.AuthHandler;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.handler.JWTAuthHandler;

public class JwtAuthHandlerFactory implements AuthHandlerFactory {

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "helloJwtAuthFactory";
  }

  @Override
  public AuthHandler create(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    PubSecKeyOptions pubSecKey = new PubSecKeyOptions(config);
    JWTAuthOptions jwtAuthOptions = new JWTAuthOptions().addPubSecKey(pubSecKey);
    return JWTAuthHandler.create(JWTAuth.create(vertx, jwtAuthOptions));
  }
}
```

We're creating a configuration based on the config JSON the factory receives from `operations.conf` and return a [`JWTAuthHandler`](https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/ext/web/handler/JWTAuthHandler.html) that does all the authentication for us.

As always, let's not forget to register our handler factory:

`io.knotx.server.api.security.AuthHandlerFactory`
```
io.knotx.examples.security.auth.JwtAuthHandlerFactory
```

## Build & Run

Now let's rebuild the project.

> Remember to stop any running containers! If there is a container that uses the `8092` port (the one we're using), our container will not start. You can use this command to stop all running containers: `docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)`

Let's build the image:

```
$ gradlew clean build-docker
```

and run it:

```
$ docker run -p8092:8092 knotx-example/secure-api-gateway
```

After a while the Docker container should be up and running.

Let's try accessing our endpoint:

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/api/secure/jwt
Unauthorized
```

We were not authorized to access this endpoint.

We need an `Authorization` header for our request. As mentioned before, we'll mimic a successful login and we'll generate the token ourselves.

There are many ways to generate a token. We'll use [`jwt.io`](https://jwt.io/).

Open the page, scroll to the Debugger section and generate the token:

![Generating JWT using jwt.io](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-generate-jwt.png)

1. Select `HS256` as the algorithm.
2. Fill in the key you used in the configuration.
3. Copy the generated token.

Now let's try this `curl` command with `Authorization` header:

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/api/secure/jwt -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIn0.vPWK59pl5GWimz8UVbL3CmrceSfmNvvCgyzwLVV9jT8'
{"message":"Hello World From Knot.x with Basic Auth!"}
```

## Tests

Just as we did in Basic Auth scenario, we can easily test the security of our endpoint in a functional test. Let's create a new one in the same place we created the `BasicAuthITCase.java`:

`JWTAuthITCase.java`
```java
class JWTAuthITCase {

  @Test
  @DisplayName("GIVEN no authorization WHEN call JWT secured API EXPECT Unauthorized")
  void givenNoAuthorizationWhenCallBasicAuthApiExpectUnauthorized() {
    given()
        .port(8092)
      .when()
        .get("/api/secure/jwt")
      .then()
        .assertThat()
        .statusCode(401);
  }

  @Test
  @DisplayName("GIVEN authorization WHEN call JWT secured API EXPECT Ok")
  void givenAuthorizationWhenCallBasicAuthApiExpectOk() {
    given()
        .port(8092)
        .header("Authorization", "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIn0.vPWK59pl5GWimz8UVbL3CmrceSfmNvvCgyzwLVV9jT8")
      .when()
        .get("/api/secure/jwt")
      .then()
        .assertThat()
        .statusCode(200);
  }
}
```

As previously, we test two scenarios: unauthorized and authorized access.

# OAuth2 & Google Account

Now we'll do something even more ambitious.

We'll use our own Google Account and OAuth2 to authorize a request to Google API to print a personalized hello message!

## OAuth2 flow

[OAuth2](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/which-oauth-flow-to-use) is all about flows.
We'll use the most common one - [Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/).

The diagram below shows the flow we'll implement:

![OAuth 2 flow](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-oauth2-flow.png)

1. The user accesses `/api/secure/login` in the browser.
2. Server responds with a redirect to Google consent screen, providing the application id to the request.
3. The user logs in to his Google Account and allows our application to access his user details.
4. The consent screen redirects the browser to `/api/secure/oauth2` with a special token called [authorization code](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) passed as a `code` query parameter.
5. The server is exchanging the authorization code for user's access token. The request must also contain application's client secret.
6. Having the user's access token, the server can access API endpoints on behalf of the user. In our case we'll invoke an endpoint that will provide us with basic user info.
7. Having the user info, we'll produce the final response with a personalized *hello* message.

## Google Account Setup

Now let's create a new application in Google API.

First, you have to [log in to your Google Account](https://www.google.com/accounts/login) (or create a new one if you don't have one already).

Now let's navigate to [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and create a new project.

![Create new Google API project part 1](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-google-new-project.png)

Name it however you want and click `Create`.

![Create new Google API project part 2](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-google-project-name.png)

Now we have to configure the consent screen.

![Configure consent screen](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-google-consent-screen.png)

1. Open the consent screen tab.
2. Type in a name for your application.
3. Specify the [scope](https://oauth.net/2/scope/) of the consent. The most important in our case is `profile` which is an alias for `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`
4. Save the configuration.

After saving, you will be prompted to create new client credentials (if not, just open the Credentials tab on the left and add a new credential).

![Add a new credential](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-google-new-credential.png)

Select `OAuth2 Client ID` from the dropdown and proceed.

![Create credential](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-google-create-credential.png)

1. Select `Web application` as Application type.
2. Type in a name for your credential.
3. Add allowed redirect URIs. In our case it will be `http://localhost:8092/api/secure/oauth2`

Click `Create` and proceed.

![Client credentials](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-google-client-id.png)

And that's it. Here's the `client ID` and `client secret` of our application. Don't close this window, we'll need them later.

> Take care not to expose your credentials anywhere publicly!

## Design & Setup

Now let's get back to our project.

We'll need two new endpoints. Let's define them in `openapi.yaml`:
```yaml
paths:
  // ...
  /api/secure/login:
    get:
      operationId: oauth2-redirect-operation
      responses:
        '303':
          description: Google Account login redirect
  /api/secure/oauth2:
    get:
      operationId: hello-world-operation-oauth2
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Hello World API protected with JWT
        '401':
          description: Anauthorized access
```

We're not defining any security schema in this example. The implementation will assure that the endpoints will not work without proper authorization.

Now let's take a look on configuration of two new operations:
`knotx/conf/routes/operations.conf`
```hocon
routingOperations = ${routingOperations} [
  // ...
  {
    operationId = oauth2-redirect-operation
    handlers = [
      {
        name = google-login-redirect-handler
        config = {
          clientId = ${googleConfig.clientId}
          redirectUri = "http://localhost:8092/api/secure/oauth2"
          scope = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  {
    operationId = hello-world-operation-oauth2
    handlers = [
      {
        name = oauth2-hello-handler-factory
        config = {
          redirectUri = "http://localhost:8092/api/secure/oauth2"
          clientId = ${googleConfig.clientId}
          clientSecret = ${googleConfig.clientSecret}
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]

// ...

googleConfig = {
  clientId = "someClientIdYouReceivedFromGoogle"
  clientSecret = "someClientSecretYouReceivedFromGoogle-TakeExtraCareNotToExposeItAnywherePublicly"
}
```

We'll use two new factories which we'll implement in the next step. As shown above, we're passing appropriate configuration to each one of them. Notice how we use the features of [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md): we defined an additional object `googleConfig` in order to avoid repeating the values for the two handler factory configurations.

## Implementation

> In case you didn't complete the _Basic Auth_ of this tutorial, you might want to scroll up a bit to the _Authentication Handler implementation_ part and see the `security-module` structure we defined there. Don't forget to add the module in `settings.gradle.kts` as well!

Now let's implement the factories we have just defined. Let's put them in the `io.knotx.examples.security.routing` package in the `security-module` module.

`GoogleLoginRedirectHandlerFactory.java`
```java
package io.knotx.examples.security.routing;

import io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory;
import io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpResponseStatus;
import io.vertx.core.Handler;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.core.logging.Logger;
import io.vertx.core.logging.LoggerFactory;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.RoutingContext;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;
import org.apache.http.client.utils.URIBuilder;


public class GoogleLoginRedirectHandlerFactory implements RoutingHandlerFactory {

  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GoogleLoginRedirectHandlerFactory.class);

  private static final String AUTH_URL = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth";

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "google-login-redirect-handler";
  }

  @Override
  public Handler<RoutingContext> create(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    try {
      String authorizationUri = getAuthorizationUri(config);

      return event -> event.response()
          .putHeader("Location", authorizationUri)
          .setStatusCode(HttpResponseStatus.SEE_OTHER.code())
          .end();
    } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
      LOGGER.error("Error while building the authorization URI: {}", e);
      return event -> event.response().setStatusCode(HttpResponseStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.code()).end();
    }
  }

  private static String getAuthorizationUri(JsonObject config) throws URISyntaxException {
    String redirectUri = config.getString("redirectUri");
    String scope = config.getString("scope");
    String clientId = config.getString("clientId");
    String state = RandomStringUtils.random(20);
    String nonce = RandomStringUtils.random(20);

    if (StringUtils.isAnyBlank(redirectUri, scope, clientId)) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Configuration for Google Auth must include redirectUri, clientId and scope");
    }

    return new URIBuilder(AUTH_URL)
        .addParameter("redirect_uri", redirectUri)
        .addParameter("scope", scope)
        .addParameter("client_id", clientId)
        .addParameter("state", state)
        .addParameter("nonce", nonce)
        .addParameter("prompt", "consent")
        .addParameter("access_type", "offline")
        .addParameter("response_type", "code")
        .build().toString();
  }
}
```

As described earlier, this handler will result in a redirect response. We're building the redirect URL based on [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#creatingclient):

- `redirect_uri` is the URI that will serve as a redirect from the consent screen after successful login and consent click
- `scope` is used to define which part of the user's resources we want to access (more info [here](https://oauth.net/2/scope/))
- `client_id` is the client id we received in the previous chapter
- `state` and `nonce` are some random string values, used by the server to identify the request, see [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#creatingclient) for further details
- `prompt` means we're looking for a `consent` screen
- `access_type` needs to be `offline` in order to obtain the token from a web server
- `response_type` means we want a code to be returned in the redirect

`OAuth2HelloHandlerFactory.java`
```java
package io.knotx.examples.security.routing;

import io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory;
import io.vertx.core.Handler;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.RoutingContext;

public class OAuth2HelloHandlerFactory implements RoutingHandlerFactory {

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "oauth2-hello-handler-factory";
  }

  @Override
  public Handler<RoutingContext> create(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    return new OAuth2HelloHandler(vertx, config);
  }
}

```

Since our handlers are getting quite big, let's put it in a separate file:

`OAuth2HelloHandler.java`
```java
package io.knotx.examples.security.routing;

import io.reactivex.Single;
import io.vertx.core.Handler;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.core.logging.Logger;
import io.vertx.core.logging.LoggerFactory;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.buffer.Buffer;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.RoutingContext;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.client.HttpRequest;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.client.HttpResponse;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.client.WebClient;
import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;

public class OAuth2HelloHandler implements Handler<RoutingContext> {

  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(OAuth2HelloHandler.class);

  private static final String USERINFO_URL = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo";

  private static final String TOKEN_URL = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token";

  private WebClient webClient;

  private JsonObject config;

  OAuth2HelloHandler(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    webClient = WebClient.create(vertx);
    this.config = config;
  }

  @Override
  public void handle(RoutingContext event) {
    String code = event.request().getParam("code");

    exchangeCodeForToken(code)
        .flatMap(this::fetchUserInfo)
        .subscribe(response -> {
          LOGGER.info("Response from Google userinfo endpoint: {}", response.statusCode());

          JsonObject body = response.bodyAsJsonObject();
          String name = body.getString("name");

          event.response().end("Hello " + name);
        }, error -> LOGGER.error("An error occurred: {}", error));
  }

  private Single<String> exchangeCodeForToken(String code) {
    return prepareTokenRequest(code, config)
        .rxSend()
        .map(response -> {
          LOGGER.info("Response from Google token endpoint: {}", response.statusCode());
          JsonObject body = response.bodyAsJsonObject();
          return body.getString("access_token");
        });
  }

  private HttpRequest<Buffer> prepareTokenRequest(String code, JsonObject config) {
    String clientId = config.getString("clientId");
    String clientSecret = config.getString("clientSecret");
    String redirectUri = config.getString("redirectUri");

    if (StringUtils.isAnyBlank(code, clientId, clientSecret, redirectUri)) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Configuration for Google Auth must include code, clientId, clientSecret and redirectUri");
    }

    return webClient.postAbs(TOKEN_URL)
        .setQueryParam("code", code)
        .setQueryParam("client_id", clientId)
        .setQueryParam("client_secret", clientSecret)
        .setQueryParam("redirect_uri", redirectUri)
        .setQueryParam("grant_type", "authorization_code")
        .putHeader("Content-Length", "0");
  }

  private Single<HttpResponse<Buffer>> fetchUserInfo(String accessToken) {
    return webClient.getAbs(USERINFO_URL)
        .bearerTokenAuthentication(accessToken)
        .rxSend();
  }

}

```

Let's take a look at this file step by step:

1. The constructor is quite straightforward, we create a new [`webClient`](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-client/java/) and save the config for later use.
2. When a request hits our handler, the `handle` method is invoked. We try to obtain the authorization code from the request.
3. Then we try to `exchangeCodeForToken`. The first step is to `prepareTokenRequest`. This time we have to provide the `code`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uri`, `grant_type` parameters and `Content-Length` header (this will be a `POST` request). For more details on those parameters see [this documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#exchange-authorization-code). We send the request using `rxSend` method (for more info about Vert.x's RxJava 2 API check [this documentation](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-client/java/#_rxjava_2_api)) and map the response to the acquired access token.
4. We map the resulting observable with the token to `fetchUserInfo` which creates a `GET` request to Google API with the bearer token authentication and sends it.
5. Finally we subscribe for the whole processing chain and end our response with a personalized *hello* message!

As always, let's not forget to register our factories in the `resources/META_INF/services` directory!

`io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory`
```
io.knotx.examples.security.routing.GoogleLoginRedirectHandlerFactory
io.knotx.examples.security.routing.OAuth2HelloHandlerFactory
```

## Build & Run

Now let's see how it works.

First, let's build the project (as mentioned before, remember to stop all the running containers!):

```
$ gradlew clean build-docker
```

and run it:

```
$ docker run -p8092:8092 knotx-example/secure-api-gateway
```

Now let's type in `http://localhost:8092/api/secure/login` in your browser.

![Select Google Account](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-google-select-account.png)

Select your account.

![Select Google Account](/img/blog/api-gateway-security/security-google-hello-message.png)

And there is our personalized hello message!

# Summary

In this tutorial we have successfully secured our API Gateway with various authentication methods.

Using Basic Auth we can set up credential-based security in no time! The beauty of this is that the business logic is not aware of the security layer standing right in front of it.

Often, passing user credentials in every call, is far from satisfactory in larger applications. For more complex uses we demonstrated how to incorporate JWT implementation to our stack. Again, this is just a layer on top of business logic.

If you wish to use external security manners provided by Google or other well-known providers, you can use OAuth2 flows. This way your end user has no need to create a separate account inside your application.
