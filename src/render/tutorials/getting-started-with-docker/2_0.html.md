## Overview

In this tutorial, we will set up a simple project based on the [Knot.x Starter Kit](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit) template.

We will implement a custom handler that will print a "Hello world from Knot.x!" message.

What you’re going to learn:

- How to use the [Design First approach](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/design-first-or-code-first-api-development/) to design the API's contract first before writing any code configuring [Open API specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) entries
- How to implement a custom business logic, the Knot.x [Handler](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http#knotx-http-server), and apply it to configured API

## Setup basic Knot.x project

**Prerequisites**
You will need the following things to use Knot.x:
- JDK 8
- Docker 

Download the [Latest Knot.x Starter Kit release](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit/releases) and unzip it.

Project has the following structure:
```
├── docker
|   ├── Dockerfile                // Docker file with image definition.
├── functional                    // Keep here your functional tests. Example implementation included
├── gradle                        // Gradle wrapper and common gradle scripts
├── knotx/conf                    // Knotx configuration which will be copied to docker image
├── modules                       // Sub-modules of your project
│   ├── ...                       // example modules implementation
```

## Configure API: specify path and method

When it comes to API development, two approaches are available: The “Design First” and the “Code First”. You can read more details [here](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/design-first-or-code-first-api-development/) to understand the differences between them. Knot.x uses the Design First approach focusing on developer experience and API design quality. It uses the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) to configure HTTP request routing.

The `knotx/conf/openapi.yaml` file contains project-specific API definitions using the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) syntax.

We can see three distinguishable parts of this file:

 1.  Information about the project, which is quite self-explanatory:
 
      ```yaml
      ...
      
      openapi: "3.0.0"
      info:
        version: 1.0.0
        title: Knot.x Starter Kit
        description: Knotx Starter Kit
        contact: 
          name: "Knot.x Community"
          url: "http://knotx.io/community/"
        
      ...
      ```      
 2.  Server configuration that defines how the server behaves:
 
      ```yaml
      ...
      
      servers:
        - url: https://{domain}:{port}
          description: The local API server
          variables:
            domain:
              default: localhost
              description: api domain
            port:
              enum:
                - '8092'
              default: '8092'
      
      ...
      ```
      Here we can see, for example, that the server will be registered on port `8092`. Notice variable substitution indicated by `{`brackets`}`. For more information on what can be configured here, see [this documentation](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#serverObject). 
 3.  Paths configuration that explicitly specifies the endpoints, their paths, methods, responses and much more in a clear, easily readable and declarative way:
 
      ```yaml
      ...
      
      paths: 
      
        ...   
             
        /healthcheck:
          get:
            operationId: healthcheck-operation
            # https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-health-check/java/
            responses:
              '200':
                description: Everything is fine
              '204':
                description: No procedure are registered.
              '501':
                description: At least one procedure has reported a non-healthy status
              '500':
                description: One procedure has thrown an error or has not reported a status in time
      ...
      ```
      
> In OpenAPI terms, paths are endpoints (resources), such as `/users` or `/reports/summary/`, that your API exposes, and operations are the HTTP methods used to manipulate these paths, such as GET, POST or DELETE. [~source](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/))

      The Starter Kit template comes with example paths and methods defined. Let's see the `/healthcheck` API. It is used to express the current state of the application in very simple terms: UP or DOWN (more on that later in this tutorial).
      
      We can see that it is registered under `/healthcheck` path, it's method is a `GET` and it can have various responses depending on the state of the instance.
      
      A configured path and method section declares a unique operation that is used to process matching requests. In the example above, it is `healthcheck-operation`. Details how to link configured operation with the business logic implementation will be covered later.
      
Now, it is time to define a custom endpoint `/api/hello` and operation `hello-world-operation`.

Simply add new routing configuration under `paths`:
```yaml
paths:
  /api/hello:
    get:
      operationId: hello-world-operation
      responses:
        default:
          description: Example API implemented in this tutorial
```

## Configure API: define a new operation

As previously mentioned, a configured path and method indicates [operation](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#operationObject) to perform. Every operation is configured as a [Routing Operation](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/tree/master#routing-operations) entry that specifies Handlers with business logic to execute and failure Handlers when processing fails. 


All routing operation entries are configured in the `knotx/conf/routes/operations.conf` file. It is the first time the Knot.x configuration appears. It uses the HOCON (*Human-Optimized Config Object Notation*) syntax. More on HOCON  can be found in [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md).

Let's take a look at this file:

```hocon
routingOperations = ${routingOperations} [
  
  // routing operations for this project
  
]
```

`routingOperations` is an array of `routingOperation` objects. 

`${routingOperations}` takes care of merging any [previously defined](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-stack/blob/master/src/main/packaging/conf/server.conf) routing operations with the ones you define here. More about HOCON concatenation possibilities can be found [here](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#array-and-object-concatenation).

Let's take a look at an example routing operation entry we get from Starter Kit:
```hocon
  {
    operationId = healthcheck-operation
    handlers = [
      {
        name = healthcheck
      }
    ]
  }
```

The `healthcheck-operation` operation defines the array of [Handlers](https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Handler.html) with a single Handler, named `healthcheck`. Please note that Handlers can be easily reused so `healthcheck` is a Handler's factory unique name.

Let's take a look at a more complicated one:
```hocon
{
    operationId = example-api-with-fragments-operation
    handlers = ${config.server.handlers.common.request} [
      {
        name = singleFragmentSupplier
        config = {
          type = json
          configuration {
            data-knotx-task = api-task
          }
        }
      },
      {
        name = fragmentsHandler
        config = { include required(classpath("routes/handlers/api-with-fragments.conf")) }
      },
      {
        name = fragmentsAssembler
      }
    ] ${config.server.handlers.common.response}
  }
```

Here we provide not one, but three different handlers. By defining them in an array, they will be called in order they're defined. Some of them even have some additional configurations defined explicitly or in another file. They will be passed as `JsonObject`s to the handler implementation.

Notice two additional imports: `${config.server.handlers.common.request}` and `${config.server.handlers.common.response}`. Here we use the handlers defined in [Knot.x source code](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/blob/master/conf/server.conf), which simplifies handling of basic requests without repeating the configuration for similar operations.

Now, let's connect `hello-world-operation` with a handler. The name of the handler factory will be `hellohandler` (reminder: names must be unique!). We'll also make the message configurable.

Simply add new routing operation to the array:

```hocon
  {
    operationId = hello-world-operation
    handlers = [
      {
        name = hellohandler
        config = {
          message = "Hello World From Knot.x!"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

## API implementation: creating new Handler

Now it is time to code some custom logic printing *"Hello World from Knot.x!"*. We will implement the [RoutingHandlerFactory](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/blob/master/api/src/main/java/io/knotx/server/api/handler/RoutingHandlerFactory.java) interface. We use Java but you can use any JVM-based language, such as [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). Let's put it in a separate module.


Create a new module under the `modules` folder. The structure should look like this:

```
modules
└─ hellomodule
    ├── build.gradle.kts                                                        // gradle build script
    └── src 
        └── main                   
            ├── java/com/project/example/hellohandler
            │     └── HelloWorldHandlerFactory.java                             // the handler factory  
            └── resources
                  └── META-INF/services
                        └── io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory   // META-INF file used by Knot.x to find the handler   
```

Let's take a look at the three files required for the module to work.

`build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
plugins {
    `java-library`
}

dependencies {

    "io.knotx:knotx".let { v ->
        implementation(platform("$v-dependencies:${project.property("knotx.version")}"))
        api("$v-fragments-api:${project.property("knotx.version")}")
        api("$v-fragments-handler-api:${project.property("knotx.version")}")
    }
    "io.vertx:vertx".let { v ->
        implementation("$v-web")
        implementation("$v-web-client")
        implementation("$v-rx-java2")
    }
}
```

`io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory`
```
io.knotx.example.hellohandler.HelloWorldHandlerFactory
```

In this file we list, line by line, all the [RoutingHandlerFactory](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-server-http/blob/master/api/src/main/java/io/knotx/server/api/handler/RoutingHandlerFactory.java) implementations we want Knot.x to see. It has to be a canonical class name. It uses [Java ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html).

`HelloWorldHandlerFactory.java`
```
package io.knotx.example.hellohandler;

import io.knotx.server.api.handler.RoutingHandlerFactory;
import io.vertx.core.Handler;
import io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject;
import io.vertx.reactivex.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.reactivex.ext.web.RoutingContext;

public class HelloWorldHandlerFactory implements RoutingHandlerFactory {

  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return "hellohandler";    // this has to be exactly the same unique string as in operations.conf file                                                 
  }

  @Override
  public Handler<RoutingContext> create(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    String message = config.getString("message", "Some default message");
    JsonObject jsonObject = new JsonObject()
        .put("message", message);
    return event -> event.response().end(jsonObject.toString());
  }
}
```

The most important thing is to register it by its name. In this case, it was `"hellohandler"`. 

The handling it performs is simply ending the response with previously configured *"Hello World from Knot.x!"* JSON.

Finally, let's update the main project's `settings.gradle.kts` file, so that it will recognize the new module. 

Simply add those two lines:
```kotlin
include("hello-module")
```
and
```kotlin
project(":hello-module").projectDir = file("modules/hello-module")
```



## Docker

### Configuration
[Knot.x Starter Kit](https://github.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit) project builds either stack (zip distribution) or Docker image. In this tutorial, we'll use the latter.
 
 Let's rename the image. Edit `gradle.properties` and change property `docker.image.name`:

```
docker.image.name=knotx-example/knotx-docker-tutorial
```

### Run

Now we are ready to run. First, let's build your docker image:
```
$ gradlew clean build-docker
```

If you take a closer look at build log (you can use `-i` flag for a more verbose process) you can see, that not only the project is being built, but also it:

- builds the Docker image
- starts a container for testing
- runs `healthcheck` test on the container and then executes functional tests (more on that in the next section)

But what *building the Docker image* means in this case?

![Starter Kit Docker Image](/img/blog/getting-started-with-docker/starter-kit-docker.png)

The diagram above describes how it works. Starter Kit Docker Image is based on Knot.x image hosted at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), which is based on a base OpenJDK image. While building the image, we copy all custom modules (JARs) and configuration to the resulting image. 

Now let's run the dockerized Knot.x instance:
```
$ docker run -p8092:8092 knotx-example/knotx-docker-tutorial
```

### Final result

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8092/api/hello
{"message":"Hello World From Knot.x!"}
```

## Tests

Now let's take a closer look at what tests we have here.

The first test is the `healthcheck`. Technically speaking, this is not a *test*, but rather an endpoint in which, we call application's endpoints within the application. If the request succeeds, we can be sure that the Docker container is up and running.

Let's take a quick peek at `docker/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
... 

HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --timeout=2s --retries=12 \
  CMD curl --silent --fail localhost:8092/healthcheck || exit 1
  
...
```
Docker is trying to reach `localhost:8092/healthcheck` with defined interval, timeouts and retries. If `/healthcheck` returns `200` code, we can be sure that the instance is up. For more details see [this documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck).
 
 A quick recap on how to find the class implementing the handler: in `openapi.yaml` endpoint `/healthcheck` is handled by operation `healthcheck-operation`, which has one handler registered with name `healthcheck`. This leads to the class `HealthcheckHandlerFactory.java`.
 
 We'll modify it so that it will use the `/api/hello` endpoint. 

Simply change the `create` method:
```java
public Handler<RoutingContext> create(Vertx vertx, JsonObject config) {
    HealthChecks checks = HealthChecks.create(vertx);
    checks.register("API check", 200, future -> {
      WebClient webClient = WebClient.create(vertx);
      webClient.get(8092, "localhost", "/api/hello")
          .rxSend()
          .subscribe(onSuccess -> {
            JsonObject jsonResponse = onSuccess.bodyAsJsonObject();
            future.complete("Hello World From Knot.x!".equals(jsonResponse.getString("message")) ? Status.OK() : Status.KO());
          }, onError -> future
              .complete(Status.KO(new JsonObject().put("error", onError.getMessage()))));
});
```

Starter Kit has some example functional tests as well.

As this line suggests: 

`build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
sourceSets.named("test") {
    java.srcDir("functional/src/test/java")
}
```

They can be found under `functional/src/test/java`. 

For now, we have one test that comes out of the box with the Starter Kit: `ExampleApiITCase`. Let's change it as well. 

Again, we'll modify the test to use the `/api/hello` endpoint:

```java
  @Test
  @DisplayName("Expect 200 status code from hello api.")
  void callHandlersApiEndpointAndExpectOK() {
    // @formatter:off
    given().
        port(8092).
      when().
        get("/api/hello").
      then()
        .assertThat().
        statusCode(200);
    // @formatter:on
  }
```

If you look closely at [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knotx/knotx-starter-kit/master/gradle/docker.gradle.kts), you can see that task `runFunctionalTests` relies on Docker container to be up (which is ensured by `healthcheck`). Now that we have the application running, we can run integration tests by invoking various endpoints and asserting their responses. Here we use [REST-assured](http://rest-assured.io/) for this purpose.
