title: Adapt Service without Web API
description: "The Adapt Service without Web API Tutorial is the next step on our path to learning Knot.x. Today we will deal with data that comes directly from a database (we will not use a Web API layer this time). With just one simple Service Adapter, we will fetch the data and let Knot.x inject it into an HTML template."
