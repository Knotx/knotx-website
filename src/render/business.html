            <p>Letâ€™s imagine an online banking website containing different features like a chat box, exchange rates, stock data and user profile information. The site has a high performance characteristic, despite its complexity and target publishing channels.
              All those features come from different providers/vendors having their own teams working in various modes, technologies and release cycles.
              Knot.x connects all of them in a controlled and isolated way, preventing any undesired interferences. It combines asynchronous programming principles and message-driven architecture providing a scalable platform for modern sites.
              Knot.x connects all of the above to create a unified customer experience.
